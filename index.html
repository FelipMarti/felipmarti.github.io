			<h1>About me</h1>
            <p>I am a Research Engineer in Internet of Things (IoT) working at the <a href='http://www.swinburne.edu.au'>Swinburne</a>'s Digital Innovation Lab.
            Under the guidance of <a href='https://www.swinburne.edu.au/research/our-research/access-our-research/find-a-researcher-or-supervisor/researcher-profile/?id=pjayaraman'>
            A/Prof. Prem Prakash Jayaraman</a>, I am leading the research and development of industry projects related to AgriTech.

            <p> My PhD explored the integration of a general purpose social robot for ongoing clinical deployment. 
            It was pursed under the principal supervision of <a href='https://www.swinburne.edu.au/science-engineering-technology/staff/profile/index.php?id=cdmccarthy'>Dr Chris McCarthy</a>,
            and with the support of <!--<a href='http://people.csiro.au/M/F/Felip-Marticarrillo'>Data61 at CSIRO</a>-->
            Data61 at CSIRO, Melbourne.
            In a close partnership with the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne, we explored how the NAO robot can
            socially assist paediatric rehabilitation in an existing clinical practice.

            <p>I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Systems Engineering and a Master's degree in Robotics from the <a href='http://www.upc.edu'>Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC)</a>. 
            My final master's  <a href='http://lup.lub.lu.se/student-papers/record/7861160'>thesis</a> was completed on exchange at Sweden's 
            <a href='http://www.lu.se'>Lund University</a>, <a href='http://www.lth.se'>LTH</a>, <a href='http://cs.lth.se'>Department of Computer Sciences</a> 
            under the supervision of <a href='http://cs.lth.se/elin_anna_topp/'>Dr Elin Anna Topp</a>.
